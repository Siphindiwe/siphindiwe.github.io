    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am 23 years old, hailing from some rolling hill in Durban. I am fascinated about everything science and technology and to 
        jumpstart my journey towards my interests, I went to a tecchnical school, George Campbell Technical High, specialising in 
        Digital systems. A gruelling 5 years later, and another 5 years up until now, I have not found the antidote for the coding bug
        that bit and that fortuitously lead me to the UMUZI programme. I want to make strides in this career, so I too ahold of this 
        opportunity and it has brought me here... Writing a website all about me. If you are interested in more, take my hand again and
        let scroll down.

    <h4>Polynomial Solver: Python</h4> 
    <p>
        Created a mathematical program that can solve polynomials up to the n^th degree. The basis of this Polynomial solver is to find 
        the unknown roots and zeroes of the polynomial. This application is best used in the context of solving engineering, physics and
        mathematical problems. This applictaion is most similar to wolfram alpha.

    <h4>Hangman: Python</h4> 
    <p>
        A popular word game where in the program, it takes input from two players. The first user to creates a word that the second user 
        needs to guess. The number of guesses that are given to the second player are equal to the number of lines required to draw the 
        hanged man. Upon unsuccessful guesses, a full picture of the hanged man is displayed. Upon a succeful guess, victory is declared
        to the second player.

    <h4>Ping Pong: VHDL</h4> 
    <p>
        The ping pong game was interfaced with hardware on a breadboard and the vhdl board for which LED's lights provide feedback on
        the mode the game was in. The programming was logic based using the concepts of gates.

    <h4>Cafe Menu: CSS</h4> 
    <p> 
        CSS was used to enhance the graphics of a cafe menu. This includes colours, using different text styles and alignment, addition 
        of images and use of headings and sections.
