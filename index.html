    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am completing my learnership at Umuzi, specializing as a junior web developer student as part of my 
        journey of gaining more hours and skills in software coding, more specifically in UI/UX design. Due
        to this, I am expanding my exposure from hardware coding languages (Assembly and VHDL) to Javascript
        HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h4>Polynomial Solver: Python</h4> 
    <p>
        Created a mathematical program that can solve polynomials up to the n^th degree. The basis of this Polynomial solver is to find 
        the unknown roots and zeroes of the polynomial. This application is best used in the context of solving engineering, physics and
        mathematical problems. This applictaion is most similar to wolfram alpha.

    <h4>Hangman: Python</h4> 
    <p>
        A popular word game where in the program, it takes input from two players. The first user to creates a word that the second user

        hanged man, this is 10 estimates. Upon a succeful guess, victory is declared.
