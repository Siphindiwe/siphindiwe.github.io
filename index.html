    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am 23 years old, hailing from some rolling hill in Durban. I am fascinated about everything science and technology and to 
        jumpstart my journey towards my interests, I went to a tecchnical school, George Campbell Technical High, specialising in 
        Digital systems. A gruelling 5 years later, and another 5 years up until now, I have not found the antidote for the coding bug
        that bit and that fortuitously lead me to the UMUZI programme. I want to make strides in this carer, so I too ahold of this 
        opportunity and it has brought me here... Writing a website all about me. If you are interested in more, take my hand again and
        let scroll down.
