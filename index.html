        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am completing my learnership at Umuzi, specializing as a junior web developer student as part of my 
            journey of gaining more hours and skills in software coding, more specifically in UI/UX design. Due
            to this, I am expanding my exposure from hardware coding languages (Assembly and VHDL) to Javascript
            HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <p>My first introduction to HTML was through a FreeCodeCamp tutorial that served an introduction to
               HTML elements.
            </p>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <p>Due to the stream I am in of web development, there is more focus on developing Javascript skills.
               With Javascript, the main focus is on Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming.</p>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <p>In CSS, my main focus is on the development of styling required on Graphical User Interfaces. My first 
               interaction with CSS was with designing a Cafe Menu on FreeCode Camp</p>
